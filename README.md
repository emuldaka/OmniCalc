This is a calculator/converter app using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind, hosted with GitHub Pages and made with the assistance of Firebase Studio.

This app contains categories with the following:

Standard Calculator
- This is for basic math calculations and has similar functionality to the Windows Calculator.
- Can be duplicated up to 8 times, so 8 different calculators can be used at once.

Unit Converter
- 14 different types of conversions.

Advanced Science/Calculator
- This is meant to function similarly to a TI-83 calculator that most high school students are used to. (In combination with the graphing calculator in the category below, these two components can do just about anything TI-83 calculators can.)
- There are 3 of these side by side; all of them have the option to add results to storage and view history with independent data/storage for each of the 3. The 3 storage tables can also be added to directly.

Graphing Calculator
- Allows you to type, paste, or use a traditional calculator to input a formula/expression for graphing.
- 4 graphs in total.
- Stored equations component that stores your added inputs and adds 4 checkboxes to each. Each checkbox is labeled and tied to a graph, so you can display the equations on any or all of the 4 graphs. Different equations can also be stacked on the same graph.

Chemistry Hub
- Periodic Table: Has filters for categories; users can click on an element for detailed information on that specific element.
- Molar Mass Simple Calculator
- Stoichiometry Solver
- Solution Dilution Calculator
- pH/pOH Calculator
- Basic info sections on: 6 Common Chemical Reaction Types & Quick Guide to Balancing Chemical Equations

Physics Hub
- Kinematics Calculator
- Force & Energy Calculator
- Relativity Calculator
- Optics Calculator
- Electromagnetism Calculator

Banking Calculator
- Credit Card Payoff Calculator
- Loan Calculator with optional bi-weekly payment calculator, which will display the difference in time and money between bi-weekly and monthly payments
- Bond Calculator
- Savings Growth Calculator

Settings
- Adjust decimal point accuracy desired in outputs.
